#+title: Emacs From Scratch Configuration
#+PROPERTY: header-args:emacs-lisp :tangle ./init.el :mkdirp yes

* Welcome!

This is the configuration we've been building in the *Emacs From Scratch* series, now written as an Org Mode document.  This file generates [[file:init.el][init.el]] which can be loaded by Emacs at startup.

*NOTE:* If you run into any issues while using this configuration, please [[https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/issues/new][file an issue]] or send me an email at =david at systemcrafters.cc=.

The following variables are used to tweak some of the configuration pieces for use in the live streams so you might need to adjust them for your local machine if you try to use this configuration directly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

;; NOTE: init.el is now generated from Emacs.org.  Please edit that file
;;       in Emacs and init.el will be generated automatically!

;; You will most likely need to adjust this font size for your system!
(defvar efs/default-font-size 150)
(defvar efs/default-variable-font-size 150)

#+end_src

* Tips for Use

In this document I've added links in many places that lead you to documentation for the various packages we use.  If you're looking at this file in Emacs, you can put your cursor on a link and press =C-c C-o= or run =M-x org-open-at-point= to open the link in your web browser.

* Keep .emacs.d Clean

I don't want a bunch of transient files showing up as untracked in the Git repo so I move them all to another location.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

;; Keep transient cruft out of ~/.emacs.d/
(setq user-emacs-directory "~/.cache/emacs/"
      backup-directory-alist `(("." . ,(expand-file-name "backups" user-emacs-directory)))
      url-history-file (expand-file-name "url/history" user-emacs-directory)
      auto-save-list-file-prefix (expand-file-name "auto-save-list/.saves-" user-emacs-directory)
      projectile-known-projects-file (expand-file-name "projectile-bookmarks.eld" user-emacs-directory))

#+end_src

* Package System Setup

Emacs has a built in package manager but it doesn't make it easy to automatically install packages on a new system the first time you pull down your configuration.  [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] is a really helpful package used in this configuration to make it a lot easier to automate the installation and configuration of everything else we use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Initialize package sources
  (require 'package)

  (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                           ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
                           ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))

  (package-initialize)
  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))

    ;; Initialize use-package on non-Linux platforms
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))

  (require 'use-package)
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)

#+end_src

* Basic UI Configuration

This section configures basic UI settings that remove unneeded elements to make Emacs look a lot more minimal and modern.  If you're just getting started in Emacs, the menu bar might be helpful so you can remove the =(menu-bar-mode -1)= line if you'd like to still see that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (setq inhibit-startup-message t)

  (scroll-bar-mode -1)        ; Disable visible scrollbar
  (tool-bar-mode -1)          ; Disable the toolbar
  (tooltip-mode -1)           ; Disable tooltips
  (set-fringe-mode 10)        ; Give some breathing room
  (menu-bar-mode -1)            ; Disable the menu bar

  (column-number-mode)
  (global-display-line-numbers-mode t)

  ;; Disable line numbers for some modes
  (dolist (mode '(org-mode-hook
                  term-mode-hook
                  shell-mode-hook
                  treemacs-mode-hook
                  eshell-mode-hook))
    (add-hook mode (lambda () (display-line-numbers-mode 0))))

#+end_src

** Font Configuration

I am using the [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][Fira Code]] and [[https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cantarell][Cantarell]] fonts for this configuration which will more than likely need to be installed on your machine.  Both can usually be found in the various Linux distro package managers or downloaded from the links above.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Victor Mono SemiBold" :height efs/default-font-size)

;; Set the fixed pitch face
(set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "Victor Mono SemiBold" :height efs/default-font-size)

;; Set the variable pitch face
(set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "Cantarell" :height efs/default-font-size :weight 'regular)

#+end_src

** Emacs Dashboard
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package dashboard
    :ensure t
    :config
    (dashboard-setup-startup-hook)
    (setq dashboard-startup-banner 'logo)
    (setq dashboard-center-content t))
 

#+end_src

* Editing Configuration
** Tab Widths
  Default to an indentation size of 2 spaces since it’s the norm for pretty much every language I use.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (setq-default tab-width 2)
  (setq-default evil-shift-width tab-width)

#+end_src


** Use spaces instead of tabs for indentation
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

#+end_src

* Keybinding Configuration

This configuration uses [[https://evil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][evil-mode]] for a Vi-like modal editing experience.  [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]] is used for easy keybinding configuration that integrates well with which-key.  [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][evil-collection]] is used to automatically configure various Emacs modes with Vi-like keybindings for evil-mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Make ESC quit prompts
  (global-set-key (kbd "<escape>") 'keyboard-escape-quit)

  (use-package general
    :config
    (general-create-definer rune/leader-keys
      :keymaps '(normal insert visual emacs)
      :prefix "SPC"
      :global-prefix "C-SPC")

    (rune/leader-keys
      "t"  '(:ignore t :which-key "toggles")
      "tt" '(counsel-load-theme :which-key "choose theme")))

  (use-package evil
    :init
    (setq evil-want-integration t)
    (setq evil-want-keybinding nil)
    (setq evil-want-C-u-scroll t)
    (setq evil-want-C-i-jump nil)
    :config
    (evil-mode 1)
    (define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd "C-g") 'evil-normal-state)
    (define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd "C-h") 'evil-delete-backward-char-and-join)

    ;; Use visual line motions even outside of visual-line-mode buffers
    (evil-global-set-key 'motion "j" 'evil-next-visual-line)
    (evil-global-set-key 'motion "k" 'evil-previous-visual-line)

    (evil-set-initial-state 'messages-buffer-mode 'normal)
    (evil-set-initial-state 'dashboard-mode 'normal))

  (use-package evil-collection
    :after evil
    :config
    (evil-collection-init))
    
  (use-package evil-commentary
    :init
    (evil-commentary-mode))


#+end_src

* Buffer Management

** Bindings

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (rune/leader-keys
    "b"   '(:ignore t :which-key "buffers")
    "bb"  'counsel-switch-buffer
    "bd"  'bury-buffer)

#+end_src
* File Browsing

** Dired

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (rune/leader-keys
    "d"   '(:ignore t :which-key "dired")
    "dd"  '(dired :which-key "Here"))
    ;; "dh"  `(,(dw/dired-link "~") :which-key "Home")
    ;; "dn"  `(,(dw/dired-link "~/Notes") :which-key "Notes")
    ;; "do"  `(,(dw/dired-link "~/Downloads") :which-key "Downloads")
    ;; "dp"  `(,(dw/dired-link "~/Pictures") :which-key "Pictures")
    ;; "dv"  `(,(dw/dired-link "~/Videos") :which-key "Videos")
    ;; "d."  `(,(dw/dired-link "~/.dotfiles") :which-key "dotfiles")
    ;; "de"  `(,(dw/dired-link "~/.emacs.d") :which-key ".emacs.d"))

#+end_src

* UI Configuration

** Command Log Mode

[[https://github.com/lewang/command-log-mode][command-log-mode]] is useful for displaying a panel showing each key binding you use in a panel on the right side of the frame.  Great for live streams and screencasts!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package command-log-mode)

#+end_src

** Color Theme

[[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][doom-themes]] is a great set of themes with a lot of variety and support for many different Emacs modes.  Taking a look at the [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes/tree/screenshots][screenshots]] might help you decide which one you like best.  You can also run =M-x counsel-load-theme= to choose between them easily.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package doom-themes
  :init (load-theme 'doom-one t))

#+end_src

** Better Modeline

[[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][doom-modeline]] is a very attractive and rich (yet still minimal) mode line configuration for Emacs.  The default configuration is quite good but you can check out the [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline#customize][configuration options]] for more things you can enable or disable.

*NOTE:* The first time you load your configuration on a new machine, you'll need to run `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts` so that mode line icons display correctly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package all-the-icons)

(use-package doom-modeline
  :init (doom-modeline-mode 1)
  :custom ((doom-modeline-height 15)))

#+end_src

** Which Key

[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] is a useful UI panel that appears when you start pressing any key binding in Emacs to offer you all possible completions for the prefix.  For example, if you press =C-c= (hold control and press the letter =c=), a panel will appear at the bottom of the frame displaying all of the bindings under that prefix and which command they run.  This is very useful for learning the possible key bindings in the mode of your current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package which-key
  :init (which-key-mode)
  :diminish which-key-mode
  :config
  (setq which-key-idle-delay 1))

#+end_src

** Ivy and Counsel

[[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Ivy]] is an excellent completion framework for Emacs.  It provides a minimal yet powerful selection menu that appears when you open files, switch buffers, and for many other tasks in Emacs.  Counsel is a customized set of commands to replace `find-file` with `counsel-find-file`, etc which provide useful commands for each of the default completion commands.

[[https://github.com/Yevgnen/ivy-rich][ivy-rich]] adds extra columns to a few of the Counsel commands to provide more information about each item.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (use-package ivy
      :diminish
      :bind (("C-s" . swiper)
             :map ivy-minibuffer-map
             ("TAB" . ivy-alt-done)
             ("C-l" . ivy-alt-done)
             ("C-j" . ivy-next-line)
             ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
             :map ivy-switch-buffer-map
             ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
             ("C-l" . ivy-done)
             ("C-d" . ivy-switch-buffer-kill)
             :map ivy-reverse-i-search-map
             ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
             ("C-d" . ivy-reverse-i-search-kill))
      :config
      (ivy-mode 1))

    (use-package ivy-rich
      :init
      (ivy-rich-mode 1))

    (use-package counsel
      :bind (("C-M-j" . 'counsel-switch-buffer)
             :map minibuffer-local-map
             ("C-r" . 'counsel-minibuffer-history))
      :config
      (counsel-mode 1))
      
    (rune/leader-keys
        "r"   '(ivy-resume :which-key "ivy resume")
        "f"   '(:ignore t :which-key "files")
        "ff"  '(counsel-find-file :which-key "open file")
        "C-f" 'counsel-find-file
        "fr"  '(counsel-recentf :which-key "recent files")
        "fR"  '(revert-buffer :which-key "revert file")
        "fj"  '(counsel-file-jump :which-key "jump to file"))

#+end_src

** Helpful Help Commands

[[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][Helpful]] adds a lot of very helpful (get it?) information to Emacs' =describe-= command buffers.  For example, if you use =describe-function=, you will not only get the documentation about the function, you will also see the source code of the function and where it gets used in other places in the Emacs configuration.  It is very useful for figuring out how things work in Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package helpful
    :custom
    (counsel-describe-function-function #'helpful-callable)
    (counsel-describe-variable-function #'helpful-variable)
    :bind
    ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function)
    ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command)
    ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable)
    ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key))

#+end_src

** Text Scaling

This is an example of using [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]] to design a transient key binding for quickly adjusting the scale of the text on screen.  We define a hydra that is bound to =C-s t s= and, once activated, =j= and =k= increase and decrease the text scale.  You can press any other key (or =f= specifically) to exit the transient key map.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package hydra)

  (defhydra hydra-text-scale (:timeout 4)
    "scale text"
    ("j" text-scale-increase "in")
    ("k" text-scale-decrease "out")
    ("f" nil "finished" :exit t))

  (rune/leader-keys
    "ts" '(hydra-text-scale/body :which-key "scale text"))

#+end_src

* Org Mode

[[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] is one of the hallmark features of Emacs.  It is a rich document editor, project planner, task and time tracker, blogging engine, and literate coding utility all wrapped up in one package.

** Better Font Faces

The =efs/org-font-setup= function configures various text faces to tweak the sizes of headings and use variable width fonts in most cases so that it looks more like we're editing a document in =org-mode=.  We switch back to fixed width (monospace) fonts for code blocks and tables so that they display correctly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun efs/org-font-setup ()
    ;; Replace list hyphen with dot
    (font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode
                            '(("^ *\\([-]\\) "
                               (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "•"))))))

    ;; Set faces for heading levels
    (dolist (face '((org-level-1 . 1.2)
                    (org-level-2 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-3 . 1.05)
                    (org-level-4 . 1.0)
                    (org-level-5 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-6 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-7 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-8 . 1.1)))
      (set-face-attribute (car face) nil :font "Cantarell" :weight 'regular :height (cdr face)))

    ;; Ensure that anything that should be fixed-pitch in Org files appears that way
    (set-face-attribute 'org-block nil :foreground nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch)
    (set-face-attribute 'org-code nil   :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-table nil   :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-verbatim nil :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-special-keyword nil :inherit '(font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-meta-line nil :inherit '(font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-checkbox nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch))

** Basic Config

This section contains the basic configuration for =org-mode= plus the configuration for Org agendas and capture templates.  There's a lot to unpack in here so I'd recommend watching the videos for [[https://youtu.be/VcgjTEa0kU4][Part 5]] and [[https://youtu.be/PNE-mgkZ6HM][Part 6]] for a full explanation.

*** Nicer Heading Bullets

[[https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets][org-bullets]] replaces the heading stars in =org-mode= buffers with nicer looking characters that you can control.  Another option for this is [[https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode][org-superstar-mode]] which we may cover in a later video.

*** Center Org Buffers

We use [[https://github.com/joostkremers/visual-fill-column][visual-fill-column]] to center =org-mode= buffers for a more pleasing writing experience as it centers the contents of the buffer horizontally to seem more like you are editing a document.  This is really a matter of personal preference so you can remove the block below if you don't like the behavior.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun efs/org-mode-visual-fill ()
    (setq visual-fill-column-width 100
          visual-fill-column-center-text t)
    (visual-fill-column-mode 1))

  (use-package visual-fill-column
    :hook (org-mode . efs/org-mode-visual-fill))

#+end_src

** Configure Babel Languages

To execute or export code in =org-mode= code blocks, you'll need to set up =org-babel-load-languages= for each language you'd like to use.  [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages.html][This page]] documents all of the languages that you can use with =org-babel=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (org-babel-do-load-languages
    'org-babel-load-languages
    '((emacs-lisp . t)
      (python . t)))

  (push '("conf-unix" . conf-unix) org-src-lang-modes)

#+end_src

** Auto-tangle Configuration Files

This snippet adds a hook to =org-mode= buffers so that =efs/org-babel-tangle-config= gets executed each time such a buffer gets saved.  This function checks to see if the file being saved is the Emacs.org file you're looking at right now, and if so, automatically exports the configuration here to the associated output files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Automatically tangle our Emacs.org config file when we save it
  (defun efs/org-babel-tangle-config ()
    (when (string-equal (buffer-file-name)
                        (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/Emacs.org"))
      ;; Dynamic scoping to the rescue
      (let ((org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil))
        (org-babel-tangle))))

  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'efs/org-babel-tangle-config)))

** Languages

*** IDE Features with lsp-mode

**** lsp-mode

We use the excellent [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]] to enable IDE-like functionality for many different programming languages via "language servers" that speak the [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/][Language Server Protocol]].  Before trying to set up =lsp-mode= for a particular language, check out the [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/languages/][documentation for your language]] so that you can learn which language servers are available and how to install them.

The =lsp-keymap-prefix= setting enables you to define a prefix for where =lsp-mode='s default keybindings will be added.  I *highly recommend* using the prefix to find out what you can do with =lsp-mode= in a buffer.

The =which-key= integration adds helpful descriptions of the various keys so you should be able to learn a lot just by pressing =C-c l= in a =lsp-mode= buffer and trying different things that you find there.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun efs/lsp-mode-setup ()
    (setq lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-segments '(path-up-to-project file symbols))
    (lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-mode))

  (use-package lsp-mode
    :commands (lsp lsp-deferred)
    :hook (lsp-mode . efs/lsp-mode-setup)
    :init
    (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l")  ;; Or 'C-l', 's-l'
    :config
    (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t))
    
  (rune/leader-keys
    "l"  '(:ignore t :which-key "lsp")
    "ld" 'xref-find-definitions
    "lr" 'xref-find-references
    "ln" 'lsp-ui-find-next-reference
    "lp" 'lsp-ui-find-prev-reference
    "ls" 'counsel-imenu
    "le" 'lsp-ui-flycheck-list
    "lS" 'lsp-ui-sideline-mode
    "lX" 'lsp-execute-code-action)

#+end_src

**** lsp-ui

[[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-ui/][lsp-ui]] is a set of UI enhancements built on top of =lsp-mode= which make Emacs feel even more like an IDE.  Check out the screenshots on the =lsp-ui= homepage (linked at the beginning of this paragraph) to see examples of what it can do.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package lsp-ui
    :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode)
    :custom
    (lsp-ui-doc-position 'bottom))

#+end_src

**** lsp-treemacs

[[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-treemacs][lsp-treemacs]] provides nice tree views for different aspects of your code like symbols in a file, references of a symbol, or diagnostic messages (errors and warnings) that are found in your code.

Try these commands with =M-x=:

- =lsp-treemacs-symbols= - Show a tree view of the symbols in the current file
- =lsp-treemacs-references= - Show a tree view for the references of the symbol under the cursor
- =lsp-treemacs-error-list= - Show a tree view for the diagnostic messages in the project

This package is built on the [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][treemacs]] package which might be of some interest to you if you like to have a file browser at the left side of your screen in your editor.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package lsp-treemacs
    :after lsp)

#+end_src

**** lsp-ivy

[[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ivy][lsp-ivy]] integrates Ivy with =lsp-mode= to make it easy to search for things by name in your code.  When you run these commands, a prompt will appear in the minibuffer allowing you to type part of the name of a symbol in your code.  Results will be populated in the minibuffer so that you can find what you're looking for and jump to that location in the code upon selecting the result.

Try these commands with =M-x=:

- =lsp-ivy-workspace-symbol= - Search for a symbol name in the current project workspace
- =lsp-ivy-global-workspace-symbol= - Search for a symbol name in all active project workspaces

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package lsp-ivy)

#+end_src

*** TypeScript

This is a basic configuration for the TypeScript language so that =.ts= files activate =typescript-mode= when opened.  We're also adding a hook to =typescript-mode-hook= to call =lsp-deferred= so that we activate =lsp-mode= to get LSP features every time we edit TypeScript code.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package typescript-mode
    :mode "\\.ts\\'"
    :hook (typescript-mode . lsp-deferred)
    :config
    (setq typescript-indent-level 2))

#+end_src

*Important note!*  For =lsp-mode= to work with TypeScript (and JavaScript) you will need to install a language server on your machine.  If you have Node.js installed, the easiest way to do that is by running the following command:

#+begin_src shell :tangle no

npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript

#+end_src

This will install the [[https://github.com/theia-ide/typescript-language-server][typescript-language-server]] and the TypeScript compiler package.

*** JavaScript

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(defun dw/set-js-indentation ()
  (setq js-indent-level 2)
  (setq evil-shift-width js-indent-level)
  (setq-default tab-width 2))

(use-package js2-mode
  :mode "\\.jsx?\\'"
  :config
  ;; Use js2-mode for Node scripts
  (add-to-list 'magic-mode-alist '("#!/usr/bin/env node" . js2-mode))

  ;; Don't use built-in syntax checking
  (setq js2-mode-show-strict-warnings nil)

  ;; Set up proper indentation in JavaScript and JSON files
  (add-hook 'js2-mode-hook #'dw/set-js-indentation)
  (add-hook 'json-mode-hook #'dw/set-js-indentation))

(use-package prettier-js
  :hook ((js2-mode . prettier-js-mode)
         (typescript-mode . prettier-js-mode))
  :config
  (setq prettier-js-show-errors nil))

#+end_src

*** Haskell
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package haskell-mode
    :mode "\\.hs\\'"
    )
    
  (use-package lsp-haskell)
  
(use-package ormolu
 :hook (haskell-mode . ormolu-format-on-save-mode)
 :bind

   ("C-c r" . ormolu-format-buffer)))

#+end_src

*** C/C++

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package ccls
    :hook ((c-mode c++-mode objc-mode cuda-mode) .
      (lambda () (require 'ccls) (lsp))))

#+end_src

*** HTML

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
      
  (use-package web-mode
    :mode "(\\.\\(html?\\|ejs\\|tsx\\|jsx\\)\\'"
    :config
    (setq-default web-mode-code-indent-offset 2)
    (setq-default web-mode-markup-indent-offset 2)
    (setq-default web-mode-attribute-indent-offset 2))

#+end_src

** Company Mode

[[http://company-mode.github.io/][Company Mode]] provides a nicer in-buffer completion interface than =completion-at-point= which is more reminiscent of what you would expect from an IDE.  We add a simple configuration to make the keybindings a little more useful (=TAB= now completes the selection and initiates completion at the current location if needed).

We also use [[https://github.com/sebastiencs/company-box][company-box]] to further enhance the look of the completions with icons and better overall presentation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package company
    :after lsp-mode
    :hook (lsp-mode . company-mode)
    :bind (:map lsp-mode-map
           ("<tab>" . company-indent-or-complete-common))
          ;; (:map company-active-map
          ;;  ("<tab>" . company-complete-selection))
    :custom
    (company-minimum-prefix-length 1)
    (company-idle-delay 0.0))

  (use-package company-box
    :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))

#+end_src

** Projectile

[[https://projectile.mx/][Projectile]] is a project management library for Emacs which makes it a lot easier to navigate around code projects for various languages.  Many packages integrate with Projectile so it's a good idea to have it installed even if you don't use its commands directly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package projectile
    :diminish projectile-mode
    :config (projectile-mode)
    :custom ((projectile-completion-system 'ivy))
    :bind-keymap
    ("C-c p" . projectile-command-map)
    :init
    ;; NOTE: Set this to the folder where you keep your Git repos!
    (when (file-directory-p "~/apps")
      (setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/apps")))
    (setq projectile-switch-project-action #'projectile-dired))

  (use-package counsel-projectile
    :config (counsel-projectile-mode))
    
  (rune/leader-keys
    "pf"  'counsel-projectile-find-file
    "ps"  'counsel-projectile-switch-project
    "pF"  'counsel-projectile-rg

    "pc"  'projectile-compile-project
    "pd"  'projectile-dired)

** Magit

[[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] is the best Git interface I've ever used.  Common Git operations are easy to execute quickly using Magit's command panel system.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package magit
    :custom
    (magit-display-buffer-function #'magit-display-buffer-same-window-except-diff-v1))

  (use-package evil-magit

    ;; Add a super-convenient global binding for magit-status since
    ;; I use it 8 million times a day
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-;") 'magit-status)

    (rune/leader-keys
    "g"   '(:ignore t :which-key "git")
    "gs"  'magit-status
    "gd"  'magit-diff-unstaged
    "gc"  'magit-branch-or-checkout

** Commenting

Emacs' built in commenting functionality =comment-dwim= (usually bound to =M-;=) doesn't always comment things in the way you might expect so we use [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-nerd-commenter][evil-nerd-commenter]] to provide a more familiar behavior.  I've bound it to =M-/= since other editors sometimes use this binding but you could also replace Emacs' =M-;= binding with this command.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package evil-nerd-commenter
    :bind ("M-/" . evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-lines))

#+end_src

** Rainbow Delimiters

[[https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters][rainbow-delimiters]] is useful in programming modes because it colorizes nested parentheses and brackets according to their nesting depth.  This makes it a lot easier to visually match parentheses in Emacs Lisp code without having to count them yourself.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package rainbow-delimiters
  :hook (prog-mode . rainbow-delimiters-mode))

#+end_src

** Syntax checking with Flycheck

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package flycheck
  :defer t
  :hook (lsp-mode . flycheck-mode))

#+end_src

** Smart Parens

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package smartparens
  :hook (prog-mode . smartparens-mode))

#+end_src

* Applications

** Some App

This is an example of configuring another non-Emacs application using org-mode.  Not only do we write out the configuration at =.config/some-app/config=, we also compute the value that gets stored in this configuration from the Emacs Lisp block above it.
